            <h1 class="title">ONE: BROWNIES</h1>
            <p class="info">The true origins of brownies are pretty hard to determine confidently, but the general consensus is that they were invented in the 1800s. A chef in the Palmer House Hotel created the first recipe for brownies in 1893, as a snack intended for women. Now in 2025, they are a classic dish to be consumed, especially at your grandmother's house next to her batch of cookies. PLUS, anyone can eat them now, so yay /(-0-}/</p>
            <h2 class="moolah">Average pricing: $2.50 per brownie</h2>
