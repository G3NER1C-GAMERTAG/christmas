            <p class="info">In Marvel Lore, the Infinity Gauntlet is a powerful artifact that allows the wearer to harness the powers of the Infinity Stones, six stones that each control one aspect of the universe that were made during the Big Bang. Thanos once used it to wipe out one exact half of all life in the entire universe. Until the Avengers went back in time like a bunch of chumps and retrieved the Stones and reversed the process.</p>
